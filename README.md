# UW-Schedule-Maker
This repository allows students to convert the list view of their course schedule to an ics file for their calendar applications.

# How the code should be used:
1. Go to course schedule and make sure the page is in _list view_
2. Ctrl-a the list view course schedule
3. Copy and paste course schedule text to a _.txt_ file, which will act as the input for the program
4. In the python program, replace the **texttoread.txt** file with the name of **your** _.txt_ file
5. Replace the **schedule.ics** text with the location and file name of the _.ics_ file the user would like saved on their computer
6. Run the python program making sure all the packages are installed in the ide environment

# Documents in Repo
- **readcourse.ipynb**: Python program which converts the _.txt_ file to an _.ics_ file
- **texttoread.txt**: Example text file that can be used to understand what kind of input the python program is expecting
